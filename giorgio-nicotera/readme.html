            The goal of my project is to use MapBox, a platform for creating customized maps, 
            to create an interactive map that allows, through Machine Learning, to navigate and 
            interact through different citys without using a keyboard or mouse, but with the poses 
            of our body.

        <p>
            As you can see, the city's pose depends on the main monument of that location, for example for Paris, the pose
            try to copy the structure of the Eiffel Tower, for Rio de Janeiro the Christ de Reedimer ecc.. Also the map was
            edited by me, i choose the information, the structure, the colors and even the projections and terrain.

        </video>
        <p>
            This timelapse show perfectly the buiding of the poses, first of all i choose a pose that can 
            be easly remembered and copyied, after i open the Google Teachable Machine and teach the pose
            to the platform, after i link the pose with a label of the city's name amd import it on my code.

        <img src="src/img/1-7.jpg" alt="play 1" />
        <p>
            these are the poses to do if you want to travel in the respective cities. 
        </p>
        <img src="src/video/04.mp4" alt="play 2" />
        <p class="caption">
            Every time the code recognizes the pose made through the camera, it links it to a specific action,
             in my case I provide the coordinates, the zoom and the duration of the transition from one city to another.

        <p class="caption">
            Random pose uses a mathematical calculation in code that multiplies and randomizes the coordinates, 
            resulting in any place in the world, whether it is land or ocean.
        </p>
        <img src="src/img/1-8.jpg" alt="shuffle" />
        <p class="caption">
            The idea behind this pose was to cover your eyes so as not to see where the map takes us, so reopen 
            them once and find out which place we have been casually taken to, obviously being the earth covered 
            in a very large percentage by water, it is very likely that we will be taken there.

        <img src="src/video/06.mp4" alt="next" />
        <p class="caption">
            In this case the pose is very simple, for the zoom I decided to do something very easy, using only one 
            arm to perform this simple action, the zoom depth is fixed at the moment, i.e. it doesn't allow you to zoom 
            in several times.
        </p>
        <img src="src/img/1-9.jpg" alt="next" />
        <p class="caption">
            The zoom pose allows, once an area of ​​interest has been found using the random or other specific poses, to better
             identify the elements contained in the map, such as buildings, monuments and much more, the initial zoom is 10, 
             after the pose it doubles.
